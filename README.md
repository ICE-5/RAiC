## An Architectural Framework for Distributed Semi-Autonomous Construction 
### Using Reinforcement Learning to Support Scalable Multi-Drone Construction in Dynamic Environments

Autonomous construction has been an active research topic for engineers and designers 
for many years. Meanwhile, technological advancements made in the drone industry are
continuously pushing the droneâ€™s capability boundary. The probability of drones actively
participating in additive construction is large enough to be realized in the near
future. However, currently there is no system that can control a scalable number of drones for
autonomous construction in a dynamic environment. This project aims to
develop a system for autonomous multi-drone additive construction using deep reinforcement
learning and rule-based algorithms.
