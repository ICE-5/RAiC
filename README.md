## An Architectural Framework for Distributed Semi-Autonomous Construction 
### Using Reinforcement Learning to Support Scalable Multi-Drone Construction in Dynamic Environments

Autonomous construction has been an active research topic for engineers and designers 
for many years. Meanwhile, technological advancement made in the drone industry is
continuously pushing the droneâ€™s capability boundary. The probability of drones actively
participating in additive construction is large enough to be realized in the near
future. However, there is no system that can control a scalable number of drones for
autonomous construction in a dynamic continuous environment. This thesis aims to
develop a system for autonomous multi-drone additive construction using deep reinforcement
learning-based algorithm. First, the process of multi-drone additive construction
is modeled in a computer simulation. Then state-of-art deep reinforcement learning
algorithm is applied to achieve collision avoidance in navigation. A software package
is then developed and able to be integrated into a 3d modeling software, Rhinoceros,
for future use and development for researchers and designers. Finally, this system is
applied in two experiments: bricklaying and facade coating to demonstrate usage.
